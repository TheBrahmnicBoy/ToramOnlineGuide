  <div class="Introduction">
    <p>So, you decided one day to start searching for an MMORPG!<br>
      After lots and lots of tries, you managed to find <a href="http://en.toram.jp/" target="_blank">Toram Online</a>? <br>I wonder why?<br><br>
      Maybe resonated a lot with what you wanted. OR maybe your friend recommended this game to you and you decided to try it
      out. <br><br> In either case, either you are terribly lost about what to do in the game or your friend is too busy to help you learn all the mechanics, tips, and tricks. So, I suggest reading this starting guide about Toram Online, preferably
      before you
      begin, but any time is good too. </p>

  <!--The Basic Things-->
  <div class="cards">
    <h3>The Basic Things</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <ul class="lists" id="one">
        <li>Toram Online is designed for Windows, Andriod and IOS smartphones and is also available on Steam.</li>
      </ul>

      <button type="button" name="button"><i class="fab fa-google-play">Android</button>
      <button type="button" name="button"><i class="fab fa-apple"></i>Apple</button>
      <button type="button" name="button"><i class="fab fa-steam">Steam</button>
      <button type="button" name="button"><i class="fab fa-microsoft">Windows</button>

      <ul>
        <li>Toram Online is an immersive 3rd person (non-isometric) game.</li>
        <li>It is a good good idea to read <a href="http://en.toram.jp/outline/rule/" class="page-links" target="_blank">Asobimo TOS ans Privacy Policy</a>. </strong></li>
        <li>Toram Online <strong>DOES NOT HAVE PVP</strong> as of the latest date mentioned above. If you want PVP content then you might have to search for another game.</li>
        <li>I tend to refer to monsters as mobs. Please bear with me.</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
  </div>

  <!--The Tutorial-->
  <div class="cards">
    <h3>The Tutorial</h3>
    <div class="content" id="two">
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>The tutorial makes it clear that your character doesn't have any specific lines. All lines are said by NPCs. The NPC lines are based on your most probable real-life response. There are some instances in the story where you can choose
          different options, but trust me, <u>none of them affect the story's progress or direction.</u> Just some lore if you are interested. Don't be afraid of being rude to the NPCs or whatever.</li>
        <li>Toram Online tutorial says that Combat is automated. This is only partially true. Tapping the action button once selects the nearest mob and switches the camera to it. Tapping it again makes your character continuously Normal attack it
          until it dies, after that, your character sheathes your weapon. </li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
          <li>The normal attacks are the only things automated in combat. You cannot automatically switch to a different mob. You either tap the action button to select the nearest mob or if you want to fight a specific faraway mob, tap on that mob.
            You can hold action button to see a list of all mobs and players on the map. </li>
          <li>Normal attacks deal pathetically low amounts of damage once you reach level 50 or above. (Even at level 25-30 they are weak). The main damage dealing concept in Toram Online are 'SKILLS', specifically attacking skills. You'll figure how
            to get and unlock and upgrade them on your own. Those are NOT AUTOMATED and require you to focus to use skills at the right time in the right order or to know when to stop using skills and dodge. </li>
          <li>Therefore, <strong>COMBAT IN TORAM ONLINE IS NOT AUTOMATED AND REQUIRES A LOT OF WORK.</strong> If you favor automated combat, Toram is not for you. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Wondering what happens when you kill the dragon in the tutorial?</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
          <li>It takes a long long long time to kill the dragon and you get a 'Proof of Resistance ring.' It is practically useless and is a symbol of wasting your time before the game even begins. </li>

    <h3>Ease of Playing</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>There are a lot of things not mentioned in Toram's tutorial that makes your experience of Toram much much easier. Here are some of them.</li>
        <li>Remember when I said that selecting a mob causes the camera to lock onto it? If you don't like this, you can change it using <br>「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「System」➡「Autofocus」➡「Off」. </li>
        <li>If you want to run faster, you can go to <br>「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「System」➡「Dash」➡「On」.</li>
        <li>If you don't like the annoying numbers that always pop up when you deal damage, go to <br>「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「Graphics」➡「Damage Font Size」➡「(change slider)」.</li>
        <li>If you don't like the annoying spammers spamming in the 'SHOUT' section of the chat <br>「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「Chat」➡「Chat Filtering Settings」➡「Toggle Shout」.</li>
        <li>If your phone can't handle Graphics, go to <br>「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「Graphics」and check out the settings.</li>
        <li>You can fiddle around with a lot of settings here, it would be really useful.</li>
        <li>MENU -> Map -> World map are also helpful. The update in June 2021 has made it even easier to search and teleport to places.</li>
        <li>For Making the red AOE clearer go to 「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「Graphics」. Scroll down to bottom and find 「Atk Warning Quality」and「Display Settings」.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!--Shortcuts-->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Shortcuts</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>In「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「System」➡「Shortcuts」, the different sets are literally different sets of shortcuts, for different situations. You cannot access a shortcut from set 2 if set 1 is enabled. </li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
          <li>The list is also a shortcut menu. You can tap the top of the page where it says「Page 1 ⬅」 and go to next page. Then tap the bottom "Shortcuts Off" to turn them on. </li>
          <li>How to access this list? On the home screen, there is a literal button called 'LIST'. Tap the top to go to next page, tap the bottom to close list.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Tap on your name when on the Home screen. You can set up Auto Potion (you need to have potions in your inventory and potions are not unlimited). You can also set up at what % of HP you want to consume the potion. </li>
        <li>Go to 「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「Guard/Evasion settings」➡「Set both to Manual A」. Those will be easier for you now. Once you get more understanding of those, you can change them later.</li>

        <li>You access your inventory by 「Menu」➡「Items」. Unlike most games, equipping a weapon/armor doesn't vanish it from the inventory. </li>
        <li>There are 50 inventory spaces, each can hold 99 items. A group of 99 items is called a stack. </li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
          <li>Weapons and armor and additional gear and ring are non-stackable.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>You have a storage space, similar to a 'bank locker'. You can access it at any NPC store that has that feature. Usually in Sofya City, El Scaro, and Hora Diomedea. (Unfamiliar names, yes, but soon they will be familiar.)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This also has storage space. For increasing storage space in bank you can use orbs.</li>
          <li>One orb increases one storage space in personal inventory. (which you can move around)</li>
          <li> <strong>One orb opens one inventory slot, but one orb opens 5 bank slots. Choose carefully.</strong> </li>
        </ul>
        <li>When in your inventory, tap an item. On the left are options on what to do with that item. Tap the「1/2」 icon to open up more options on what to do with that item. </li>

      <p class="shifted-p">Early game, monsters are fairly easy, so it is recommended to add all stat points to boost ATK/MATK. For now, you don't have to worry about VIT stat. Defense, MaxHp, and MaxMP can be gained from equipments.
        <br> <br> <strong>HIT and FLEE are useless,</strong> as of given date above. The game is very unbalanced with respect to those. Monsters have unreasonably high HIT and FLEE compared to players. Don't try to increase these.

  <!--Levels-->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Levels</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>The current level cap is 230 as of the given above date.</li>
        <li>Toram Online is a 2015 game, so obviously, most players are high level and most
          events are aimed at level 150+ players. But, there are also events for all levels. You need not worry.</li>
        <li>Money, (currency called spina) is currently earned by mass killing mobs with an AOE and selling the materials (mats) to the NPC stores.
          The good AOE skills unlock at level 70, and if you need boosts on those you need to be level 150+</li>
        <li>If you don't want money and want to enjoy the game and the story normally while defeating mobs with hard work, you can do that. However,
          don't expect us to help you. That is because we already have a helping system in place by the name of mercenaries. </li>
        <li>Using「MENU」➡「Community」➡「Guild」➡「Mercinaries」or just simply friend mercenaries or even hired mercenaries, you can easily fight bosses.
          Furthermore, if a boss is hard, you need to exit (standing on exit for 10 seconds) and reenter in easy mode. </li>
        <li>That's why, if you chose to do story mode while having fun, (while I will help because I enjoy helping) players will not help you and suggest you to put down your pride and do it in easy mode.
          If you want to do story with hard work and the feeling of winning, you need to do it on your own (or get a new player like you alongside)</li>
        <li>Iv'e already told you why people want to level up to level 150, it's to get stronger to fight mobs to earn spina.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="level-div">
        <h5>Do you Want to level up to 150 fast?</h5>
        <p class="shifted-p">If you are a newbie, the fastest way to get to level 150 is to play story up to chapter 9 complete. You'll be at level 150 at the end of it. People will tell you to do the next chapters too.
          No need to do that, level 150 is enough. Save it up for future when you need exp to reach a benchmark level like 205 or 200.</p>

        <p class="shifted-p">If you already have a character at level 150, then the faster way is to get your guildmates and do something called as Powerleveling. It is the most efficient way of leveling.
          But you will need strong skills (tier 4 skills unlocked at level 150) to powerlevel fast. Your Guild will be able to help much better. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!--Skills-->
  <div class="cards">
    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>Toram has a classless system meaning you can get skills from any skill tree.
          The weapon you choose in Tutorial only determines which skill page you unlock first. </li>
        <li>To upgrade skills you need to get skill pages. Those can be bought at the Sofya City library. Some pages are in books that you can't find in the library. Those books have special skills.
          Those can be purchased from other players or be won as prizes from treasure chests. (Complete chapter 2 lesson 1 to understand what those are.)'</li>
        <li>Skill pages are divide into tiers. Tier 0 to 4.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Most (NOT ALL)</strong> main weapon skill pages from tier 0 and 1 are unlocked at level 0</li>
            <li>Tier 2 pages unlock at level 30</li>
            <li>Tier 3 pages unlock at level 70</li>
            <li>Tier 4 pages unlock at level 150</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Those levels are the levels of your highest leveled character. If you have a level 120 character and a level 40 character, then even the level 40 character can use tier 3 skills.
          If you then delete the level 120 character, then whatever pages you had purchased for the level 40 character remain. But you cannot get new pages. </li>
        <li>Tier 4 skills are the strongest and help you level your other characters faster and also farm faster. Hence everyone keeps telling you to do story up to chapter 9 and to get to level 150.
          If you want, you can enjoy the game at your own pace (It helps you learn combat skills and mechanics. I recommend it) But you won't find many people around your level because, Toram is an old game. People are already high level. </li>
