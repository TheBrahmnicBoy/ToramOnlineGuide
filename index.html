      <h4>Hello, and Welcome to Toram Online !!</h4>
      <hr class="dashed-rule">
      <p>We hope you have a wonderful time playing this game. This guide is intended to help you get started! If you
        want to contribute or correct this guide, Check out the <a class="🔗" href="#contact">Contact</a> section below!
      </p>
      <p> Toram Online is an immersive 3rd person (non-isometric) MMORPG.
        <br>That means you can move the camera around,
        and the view isn't locked to a single perspective.
      </p>
      <p>Toram Online is a game from 2015, so the graphics are old school.
        <br> If you prefer better graphics, you can
        try other <a class="🔗" target="_blank" href="https://asobimo.com/">Asobimo Games</a> here.
      </p>
      <p>Also, if you came here looking for PvP, you might be disappointed. <strong>As of the given above date, there is
          no PvP feature in Toram.</strong> It is in production, but this guide makes no claims to when it may be
        actually released.</p>
      <p>
        Asobimo Inc. has it's own official guide for Toram Online here: <a class="🔗" target="_blank"
          href="https://en.toram.jp/information/detail/?information_id=6891">Toram Online Game Guide</a>. It contains a
        lot of useful tips, some of which I will not cover in this guide, since they are already covered in the official
        guide. Please check it out if you want to learn the basics about Toram Online.

                href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ToramOnline/comments/rqg17n/20211228_about_an_issue_where_the_game_gets/'>
                This Reddit Post</a> provides a solution. There is also the <a class='🔗' target='_blank'
                href='http://en.toram.jp/information/detail/?information_id=6888'>Official Notice</a>, but some
              characters on that page are not properly rendered.
            </li> <br>

            <li><strong>Unauthorized Action Detected : </strong> <br>
              This problem generally occurs when you have a program installed on your device that may be used for
              cheating purposes. It includes, but is not limited to, VPN creators, LAN simulators, autoclickers, apps
              that could be used to root the game, cheat engines, etc. <br>
              Please note that not all apps will cause this. The author used UIPath Studio for working with RPA and it
              doesn't trigger the error. <br>
              <u>Yes, we know that you may not be using the application for cheating</u> in Toram Online, however, the
              problem
              of bot accounts in Toram is <em>very prolific</em> and hence Asobimo has to take extreme precautions. <br>
              In that case, you have to use a different device rather than the one you use for work.

                If you already played Toram Online, you can choose to transfer your account, as mentioned in
                <a class='🔗' href='#install'>Installing</a> → Data Transfer.
              </p>

              <p>As you can see in the image, the warning says you can set only 8 characters max, but in practice you
                can
                enter upto 16 characters including spaces. Asobimo.Inc has not updated this section. Try not to keep
                offensive words and follow the <a class="🔗" href="http://en.toram.jp/outline/rule/"
                  target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>. </p>

              <p>Note that you cannot change your name ever (except with premium currency), and all characters will have
                this name when used in Chat.</p>

                alt="Image explaining Highlights">

              <p>The next part is pretty straightforward. There are 4 types : Male, Female, Neutral A and Neutral B.
                <br> <br> One thing to note is the Highlights don't show up on all Hair types, but a choice few as shown
                here.
              </p>

              <p>Changing the appearance also costs either premium currency, or hard to get items in-game. So design
                your character with that in mind. <br> Do note that you can always create a new character (Level 1) with
                a
                different appearance, so you don't need to spend a lot of time either.</p>

            <div class="spoiler-content">

              <p>
                Toram Online has a classless system. You can choose any weapon you want, but you can only equip one at
                a time. You can also have sub-weapons (such as a sword with a shield). <br>

                However, some of the skills are exclusive to weapons. So you can't use them without that particular
                weapon. Learn more about skills at the <a class='🔗' href='#skills'>Skills</a> section.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> You can always change your weapon, but you can't change your skillset. So while
                you can create an ALL in one character that can wield any weapon, the skill and stat points you have are
                very limited.
              </p>

              <img class="👈 screenwide-ss" src="images\en_toram_weapon_selector_.jpg" loading="lazy"
                alt="Image explaining weapon selection">

              <p>
                Don't be fooled by Asobimo's descriptions for weapons. The weapons are not labelled properly based on
                their difficulty for a newbie. A more accurate list would be : </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Staff : Easy </li>
                <li>Katana : Normal </li>
                <li>Knuckle : Easy for tank, Hard for DPS</li>
                <li>Sword : Normal</li>
                <li>Halberd: Hard</li>
                <li>Bow : Easy</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are actually more weapons than those, and different combinations of weapons. Hence, such a
                superficial description is actually really misleading. There is also the divide between tanking and
                doing damage, each of which have varying levels of difficulty.
              </p>

              <p>

                The tutorial demonstrates that your character doesn't have any specific lines. All lines are said by
                NPCs. Sometimes the NPCs act as if you have spoken something to them, even if you haven't. The game
                simply assumes that you as the player must have asked something aloud in your room.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are some instances in the story (pictured) where you can choose different options, but trust me,
                none of them affect the story's progress or direction.

                  The Level Bar is the bar that shows your current level and your current EXP. At 100%, you move to the
                  next level. It also shows your username (useful for verification on some sites), the date and the time
                  (so you know when to stop playing).

                  You can assign upto 9 skills to the Hotbar. The Quick keys may be also used for assigning skills or
                  consumables. Learn more about assigning shortcuts at the <a class='🔗' href='#shortcuts'>Shortcuts</a>

        <!-- Combat in Toram online is not automated -->
        <div>
          <h5>Combat is not Automated!</h5>
          <p>
            Toram Online tutorial says that Combat is automated. This is only partially true. Pressing the action button
            once selects the nearest mob and switches the camera to it. Pressing it again makes your character
            continuously Normal attack it until it dies, after that, your character sheathes your weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            The normal attacks are the only things automated in combat. You cannot automatically switch to a different
            mob. You either press the action button to select the nearest mob or if you want to fight a specific faraway
            mob, click on that mob. You can press TAB to see a list of all mobs and players on the map.
          </p>
          <p>
            Normal attacks deal pathetically low amounts of damage once you reach level 50 or above. (Even at level
            25-30
            they are weak). The main damage dealing concept in Toram Online are <a class='🔗' href='#skills'>Skills</a>
            ,
            specifically attacking skills. Those are NOT AUTOMATED and require you to focus to use skills at the right
            time in the right order or to know when to stop using skills and dodge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, <strong>COMBAT IN TORAM ONLINE IS NOT AUTOMATED AND REQUIRES A LOT OF WORK</strong> . If you
            favor
            automated combat, Toram is not for you.

                <br> ⇒ Do note that you are not invincible when reviving someone else, so you can die if you are not
                careful.

        <p>
          Toram Online is a multiplayer game. Unlike Albion Online, the game does not run on a single server where each
          logged in player can see every other logged in player. In that sense, Toram online is not open world sandbox.

        <!-- Servers -->
        <div>
          <h5>Server</h5>
          <p>
            A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user,
            also known as the client. Every player connects to a server located at Asobimo Inc. (Toram Online). The
            server
            is responsible for managing the game and the players. Learn more about servers <a class='🔗' target='_blank'
              href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)'>at Wikipedia</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are not sure how Asobimo Inc. hosts their servers, whether there are separate ones for International,
            Japan, Global, English, etc.

        <div>
          <h5>World</h5>

          <p>
            A server is often sharded within itself to reduce load on its computing power. A world is a shard of a
            server. (It means that the physical server is divided into multiple worlds, each with its own computing)
          </p>

          <p>
            These are the worlds in the game :

          <p>
            Depending on the availability of players in the world, the world may lag. However, reports of lag due to
            server overload are rare. If the world capacity if full, then you cannot join the world. This is true if you
            logged out and then the world becomes full. You cannot rejoin the world again if it filled up while you were
            offline. <strong>This information is important because filled servers are much more likely to have a greater
              number of players for trading and playing with.</strong>

        <div>
          <h5>Map</h5>
          <p>
            A map is place where your player can move in. The maps are not continuous, hence monsters cannot follow you
            from one map to another. The map is also not always accurately depicted by the minimap, since different
            levels of elevation are not always shown.
          </p>
          <p>
            All the areas you can physically see cannot always be accessed. Sometimes, unconventional routes are used to
            access the areas. Some of them lead to secret areas. Try to find any if you can!
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the ⟬ TAB ⟭ key on Desktop and holding the ⟦ Action ⟧ key on Mobile, you can see what areas are
            accessible from your current location, alongside players and monsters.

        <div>
          <h5>Channel</h5>
          <p>
            Even if two players are in the same map, they cannot see each other's characters or fight the same monster
            together if they are not in the same channel. A channel is a way of reducing rendering overhead. It is a way
            of grouping players together. A channel is a sub-dimension of the map.
          </p>
          <p>
            Channels are created depending upon the population of the map. A channel is created automatically when the
            population of the map is greater than a certain threshold. You cannot enter a channel if it is full.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can consider a channel to be an alternate reality version of a map. Changing channels is akin to moving
            in the 5th dimension.

            And lastly, random players cannot (or should not be able to) attack the same monster together, unless they
            are in the same party (or if in a raid, in the same alliance/guild). Sometimes, you might start attacking
            some other party's monster, but that is a bug. This is a known issue.

      <div class="content">
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>There are a lot of things not mentioned in Toram's tutorial that makes your experience of Toram much much
            easier. Here are some of them.</li>
          <li>Remember when I said that selecting a mob causes the camera to lock onto it? If you don't like this, you
            can change it using <br>「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「System」➡「Autofocus」➡「Off」. </li>
          <li>If you want to run faster, you can go to <br>「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「System」➡「Dash」➡「On」.</li>
          <li>If you don't like the annoying numbers that always pop up when you deal damage, go to
            <br>「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「Graphics」➡「Damage Font Size」➡「(change slider)」.
          </li>
          <li>If you don't like the annoying spammers spamming in the 'SHOUT' section of the chat
            <br>「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「Chat」➡「Chat Filtering Settings」➡「Toggle Shout」.
          </li>
          <li>If your phone can't handle Graphics, go to <br>「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「Graphics」and check out the settings.
          </li>
          <li>You can fiddle around with a lot of settings here, it would be really useful.</li>
          <li>MENU -> Map -> World map are also helpful. The update in June 2021 has made it even easier to search and
            teleport to places.</li>
          <li>For Making the red AOE clearer go to 「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「Graphics」. Scroll down to bottom and find 「Atk
            Warning Quality」and「Display Settings」.</li>

      <div class="content">
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>In「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「System」➡「Shortcuts」, the different sets are literally different sets of shortcuts,
            for different situations. You cannot access a shortcut from set 2 if set 1 is enabled. </li>
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>The list is also a shortcut menu. You can tap the top of the page where it says「Page 1 ⬅」 and go to next
              page. Then tap the bottom "Shortcuts Off" to turn them on. </li>
            <li>How to access this list? On the home screen, there is a literal button called 'LIST'. Tap the top to go
              to next page, tap the bottom to close list.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Tap on your name when on the Home screen. You can set up Auto Potion (you need to have potions in your
            inventory and potions are not unlimited). You can also set up at what % of HP you want to consume the
            potion. </li>
          <li>Go to 「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「Guard/Evasion settings」➡「Set both to Manual A」. Those will be easier for you now.
            Once you get more understanding of those, you can change them later.</li>

      <div class="content">
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>You access your inventory by 「Menu」➡「Items」. Unlike most games, equipping a weapon/armor doesn't vanish it
            from the inventory. </li>
          <li>There are 50 inventory spaces, each can hold 99 items. A group of 99 items is called a stack. </li>
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Weapons and armor and additional gear and ring are non-stackable.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>You have a storage space, similar to a 'bank locker'. You can access it at any NPC store that has that
            feature. Usually in Sofya City, El Scaro, and Hora Diomedea. (Unfamiliar names, yes, but soon they will be
            familiar.)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This also has storage space. For increasing storage space in bank you can use orbs.</li>
            <li>One orb increases one storage space in personal inventory. (which you can move around)</li>
            <li> <strong>One orb opens one inventory slot, but one orb opens 5 bank slots. Choose carefully.</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>When in your inventory, tap an item. On the left are options on what to do with that item. Tap the「1/2」
            icon to open up more options on what to do with that item. </li>

        <p class="shifted-p">Early game, monsters are fairly easy, so it is recommended to add all stat points to boost
          ATK/MATK. For now, you don't have to worry about VIT stat. Defense, MaxHp, and MaxMP can be gained from
          equipments.
          <br> <br> <strong>HIT and FLEE are useless,</strong> as of given date above. The game is very unbalanced with
          respect to those. Monsters have unreasonably high HIT and FLEE compared to players. Don't try to increase
          these.

            <li>Criticals never miss either, but their damage fluctuates a lot if they graze. (If an attack was going to
              miss but it was also critical, it will graze. Graze reduces stability.)</li>

      <h3>Levels</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>The current level cap is 230 as of the given above date.</li>
          <li>Toram Online is a 2015 game, so obviously, most players are high level and most
            events are aimed at level 150+ players. But, there are also events for all levels. You need not worry.</li>
          <li>Money, (currency called spina) is currently earned by mass killing mobs with an AOE and selling the
            materials (mats) to the NPC stores.
            The good AOE skills unlock at level 70, and if you need boosts on those you need to be level 150+</li>
          <li>If you don't want money and want to enjoy the game and the story normally while defeating mobs with hard
            work, you can do that. However,
            don't expect us to help you. That is because we already have a helping system in place by the name of
            mercenaries. </li>
          <li>Using「MENU」➡「Community」➡「Guild」➡「Mercinaries」or just simply friend mercenaries or even hired mercenaries,
            you can easily fight bosses.
            Furthermore, if a boss is hard, you need to exit (standing on exit for 10 seconds) and reenter in easy mode.
          </li>
          <li>That's why, if you chose to do story mode while having fun, (while I will help because I enjoy helping)
            players will not help you and suggest you to put down your pride and do it in easy mode.
            If you want to do story with hard work and the feeling of winning, you need to do it on your own (or get a
            new player like you alongside)</li>
          <li>Iv'e already told you why people want to level up to level 150, it's to get stronger to fight mobs to earn
            spina.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="level-div">
          <h5>Do you Want to level up to 150 fast?</h5>
          <p class="shifted-p">If you are a newbie, the fastest way to get to level 150 is to play story up to chapter 9
            complete. You'll be at level 150 at the end of it. People will tell you to do the next chapters too.
            No need to do that, level 150 is enough. Save it up for future when you need exp to reach a benchmark level
            like 205 or 200.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="shifted-p">If you already have a character at level 150, then the faster way is to get your
            guildmates and do something called as Powerleveling. It is the most efficient way of leveling.
            But you will need strong skills (tier 4 skills unlocked at level 150) to powerlevel fast. Your Guild will be
            able to help much better. </p>

    <!--Skills-->
    <section class="cards shadow" id="skills">
      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>Toram has a classless system meaning you can get skills from any skill tree.
            The weapon you choose in Tutorial only determines which skill page you unlock first. </li>
          <li>To upgrade skills you need to get skill pages. Those can be bought at the Sofya City library. Some pages
            are in books that you can't find in the library. Those books have special skills.
            Those can be purchased from other players or be won as prizes from treasure chests. (Complete chapter 2
            lesson 1 to understand what those are.)'</li>
          <li>Skill pages are divide into tiers. Tier 0 to 4.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Most (NOT ALL)</strong> main weapon skill pages from tier 0 and 1 are unlocked at level 0</li>
              <li>Tier 2 pages unlock at level 30</li>
              <li>Tier 3 pages unlock at level 70</li>
              <li>Tier 4 pages unlock at level 150</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Those levels are the levels of your highest leveled character. If you have a level 120 character and a
            level 40 character, then even the level 40 character can use tier 3 skills.
            If you then delete the level 120 character, then whatever pages you had purchased for the level 40 character
            remain. But you cannot get new pages. </li>
          <li>Tier 4 skills are the strongest and help you level your other characters faster and also farm faster.
            Hence everyone keeps telling you to do story up to chapter 9 and to get to level 150.
            If you want, you can enjoy the game at your own pace (It helps you learn combat skills and mechanics. I
            recommend it) But you won't find many people around your level because, Toram is an old game. People are
            already high level. </li>

          <li>Sofya City, El Scaro and Hora Diomedea have Trading boards called consignment boards. You can register
            your item there, and people will search for your item and buy it. However, the government taxes you. You can
