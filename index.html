    <h1> Toram Online </h1>
    <h2>Read this if you're new...</h2>
    <p class="punchy">Last Updated : 28th of July, 2021</p>
  </div>

  <div class="Introduction">
    <p>So, you decided one day to start searching for an MMORPG!<br>
      After lots and lots of tries, you managed to find <a href="http://en.toram.jp/" target="_blank">Toram Online</a>? <br>I wonder why?<br><br>
      Maybe resonated a lot with what you wanted. OR maybe your friend recommended this game to you and you decided to try it
      out. <br><br> In either case, either you are terribly lost about what to do in the game or your friend is too busy to help you learn all the mechanics, tips, and tricks. So, I suggest reading this starting guide about Toram Online, preferably
      before you
      begin, but any time is good too. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="cards greens">
    <h3>The Basic Things</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <ul class="lists" id="one">
        <li>Toram Online is designed for Andriod and IOS smartphones, so trying to play it on an emulator on a PC with a mouse will not be favorable to you at all. Combat AND movement would be difficult.</li>
        <li>Toram Online is an immersive 3rd person (non-isometric) and requires both hands to perform combat effectively. If you like playing with one hand, Toram may not be the game for you.</li>
        <li>You can use Emulators as a workaround, but since Asobimo Games Inc. is primarily focused on mobile gaming, we won't be getting an official PC port.</li>
        <li>Toram Online <strong>DOES NOT HAVE PVP</strong> as of the latest date mentioned above. It will however, be released this year. If you want PVP content then you might have to search for another game.</li>
        <li>I tend to refer to monsters as mobs. Please bear with me.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="cards whites">
    <h3>The Tutorial</h3>
    <div class="content" id="two">
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>The tutorial makes it clear that your character doesn't have any specific lines. All lines are said by NPCs. The NPC lines are based on your most probable real-life response. There are some instances in the story where you can choose
          different options, but trust me, <u>none of them affect the story's progress or direction.</u> Just some lore if you are interested. Don't be afraid of being rude to the NPCs or whatever.</li>
        <li>Toram Online tutorial says that Combat is automated. This is only partially true. Tapping the action button once selects the nearest mob and switches the camera to it. Tapping it again makes your character continuously Normal attack it
          until it dies, after that, your character sheathes your weapon. </li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
          <li>The normal attacks are the only things automated in combat. You cannot automatically switch to a different mob. You either tap the action button to select the nearest mob or if you want to fight a specific faraway mob, tap on that mob.
            You can hold action button to see a list of all mobs and players on the map. </li>
          <li>Normal attacks deal pathetically low amounts of damage once you reach level 50 or above. (Even at level 25-30 they are weak). The main damage dealing concept in Toram Online are 'SKILLS', specifically attacking skills. You'll figure how
            to get and unlock and upgrade them on your own. Those are NOT AUTOMATED and require you to focus to use skills at the right time in the right order or to know when to stop using skills and dodge. </li>
          <li>Therefore, <strong>COMBAT IN TORAM ONLINE IS NOT AUTOMATED AND REQUIRES A LOT OF WORK.</strong> If you favor automated combat, Toram is not for you. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Wondering what happens when you kill the dragon in the tutorial?</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
          <li>It takes a long long long time to kill the dragon and you get a 'Proof of Resistance ring.' It is practically useless and is a symbol of wasting your time before the game even begins. </li>

    <h3>Characters</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>Characters are separate experiences within the same account.</li>
        <li>All your items, your username, achievements, emblems, Premium currency, and avatars(cosmetics) are shared between all the characters.</li>
        <li>The characters don't share levels.</li>
        <li>More info on levels in 'Levels' section below.</li>
        <li>If you want to start fresh, instead of creating a new account, create a new character. That keeps any valuable items you have with you.</li>

    <h3>Ease of Playing</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>There are a lot of things not mentioned in Toram's tutorial that makes your experience of Toram much much easier. Here are some of them.</li>
        <li>Remember when I said that selecting a mob causes the camera to lock onto it? If you don't like this, you can change it using <br>「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「System」➡「Autofocus」➡「Off」. </li>
        <li>If you want to run faster, you can go to <br>「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「System」➡「Dash」➡「On」.</li>
        <li>If you don't like the annoying numbers that always pop up when you deal damage, go to <br>「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「Graphics」➡「Damage Font Size」➡「(change slider)」.</li>
        <li>If you don't like the annoying spammers spamming in the 'SHOUT' section of the chat <br>「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「Chat」➡「Chat Filtering Settings」➡「Toggle Shout」.</li>
        <li>If your phone can't handle Graphics, go to <br>「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「Graphics」and check out the settings.</li>
        <li>You can fiddle around with a lot of settings here, it would be really useful.</li>
        <li>MENU -> Map -> World map are also helpful. The update in June 2021 has made it even easier to search and teleport to places.</li>
        <li>For Making the red AOE clearer go to 「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「Graphics」. Scroll down to bottom and find 「Atk Warning Quality」and「Display Settings」.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="cards blues">
    <h3>Shortcuts</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>In「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「System」➡「Shortcuts」, the different sets are literally different sets of shortcuts, for different situations. You cannot access a shortcut from set 2 if set 1 is enabled. </li>
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>The list is also a shortcut menu. You can tap the top of the page where it says「Page 1  ⬅」 and go to next page. Then tap the bottom "Shortcuts Off" to turn them on. </li>
            <li>How to access this list? On the home screen, there is a literal button called 'LIST'. Tap the top to go to next page, tap the bottom to close list.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Tap on your name when on the Home screen. You can set up Auto Potion (you need to have potions in your inventory and potions are not unlimited). You can also set up at what % of HP you want to consume the potion. </li>
        <li>Go to 「Menu」➡「Settings」➡「Guard/Evasion settings」➡「Set both to Manual A」. Those will be easier for you now. Once you get more understanding of those, you can change them later.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Inventory</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>You access your inventory by 「Menu」➡「Items」. Unlike most games, equipping a weapon/armor doesn't vanish it from the inventory. </li>
        <li>There are 50 inventory spaces, each can hold 99 items. A group of 99 items is called a stack. </li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
          <li>Weapons and armor and additional gear and ring are non-stackable.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>You have a storage space, similar to a 'bank locker'. You can access it at any NPC store that has that feature. Usually in Sofya City, El Scaro, and Hora Diomedea. (Unfamiliar names, yes, but soon they will be familiar.)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This also has storage space. For increasing storage space in bank you can use orbs.</li>
          <li>One orb increases one storage space in personal inventory. (which you can move around)</li>
          <li> <strong>One orb opens one inventory slot, but one orb opens 5 bank slots. Choose carefully.</strong> </li>
        </ul>
        <li>When in your inventory, tap an item. On the left are options on what to do with that item. Tap the「1/2」 icon to open up more options on what to do with that item. </li>

    <h3>Stats</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p class="shifted-p">Early game, monsters are fairly easy, so it is recommended to add all stat points to boost ATK/MATK. For now, you don't have to worry about VIT stat. Defense, MaxHp, and MaxMP can be gained from equipments.
      <br> <br> <strong>HIT and FLEE are useless,</strong> as of given date above. The game is very unbalanced with respect to those. Monsters have unreasonably high HIT and FLEE compared to players. Don't try to increase these.</p>
      <div class="othersite" style=" color: black; border-color : #39A6A3; border-width :medium; border-style : dashed; border radius: 2rem;">
        'But how can I not miss if I don't increase Accuracy?'
        <br>
        <ul class="lists" >
          <li>Magic never misses, but can be guarded. It also cannot be evaded.</li>
          <li>Criticals never miss either, but their damage fluctuates a lot if they graze. (If an attack was going to miss but it was also critical, it will graze. Graze reduces stability.)</li>
        </ul>

          events are aimed at level 150+ players. But, there are also events for all levels. You need not worry.</li>
