      <h4>Hello, and Welcome to Toram Online !!</h4>
      <hr style="border-top: dashed; width: 50%; margin: 2rem auto;">
      <p>We hope you have a wonderful time playing this game. This guide is intended to help you get started! If you

      <p> Toram Online is an immersive 3rd person (non-isometric) MMORPG.<br>That means you can move the camera around,
        and the view isn't locked.</p>
      <p>Toram Online is a game from 2015, so the graphics are old school. <br> If you prefer better graphics, you can
        try other <a class="üîó" target="_blank" href="https://asobimo.com/">Asobimo Games</a> here.</p>
      <p>Also, if you came here looking for PvP, you might be disappointed. <strong>As of the given above date, there is
          no PvP feature in Toram.</strong> It is in production, but this guide makes no claims to when it may be
        actually released.</p>

              multiple devices, or if you came back to Toram after a hiatus, you have to use the system provided by
              Asobimo itself, called <a class='üîó' href="https://en.toram.jp/faq/category/?type=account">Asobimo

            <li><strong>Game crashes in Sofya City (The first city after the tutorial) on PC version : </strong> <br>
              You have to unfortunately log into Toram Online with an Android/iOS device, then go to another map. Then
              you can log into PC normally.<br>
              If you want to travel back to Sofya City, go to „ÄåMENU„Äç‚û°„ÄåSettings„Äç‚û°„ÄåChat„Äç‚û°„ÄåChat

            </li> <br>

            <li><strong>Unauthorized Action Detected : </strong> <br>
              This problem generally occurs when you have a program installed on your device that may be used for
              cheating purposes. It includes, but is not limited to, VPN creators, LAN simulators, autoclickers, apps
              that could be used to root the game, cheat engines, etc. <br>
              Please not that not all apps will cause this. The author used UIPath Studio for working with RPA and it
              doesn't trigger the error. <br>
              Yes, we know that you may not be using the application for cheating in Toram Online, however, the problem
              of bot accounts in Toram is <em>very prolific</em> and hence Asobimo has to take extreme precautions. <br>
              In that case, you have to use a different device rather than the one you use for work.

      <h3>Ease of Playing</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>There are a lot of things not mentioned in Toram's tutorial that makes your experience of Toram much much
            easier. Here are some of them.</li>
          <li>Remember when I said that selecting a mob causes the camera to lock onto it? If you don't like this, you
            can change it using <br>„ÄåMenu„Äç‚û°„ÄåSettings„Äç‚û°„ÄåSystem„Äç‚û°„ÄåAutofocus„Äç‚û°„ÄåOff„Äç. </li>
          <li>If you want to run faster, you can go to <br>„ÄåMenu„Äç‚û°„ÄåSettings„Äç‚û°„ÄåSystem„Äç‚û°„ÄåDash„Äç‚û°„ÄåOn„Äç.</li>
          <li>If you don't like the annoying numbers that always pop up when you deal damage, go to
            <br>„ÄåMenu„Äç‚û°„ÄåSettings„Äç‚û°„ÄåGraphics„Äç‚û°„ÄåDamage Font Size„Äç‚û°„Äå(change slider)„Äç.
          </li>
          <li>If you don't like the annoying spammers spamming in the 'SHOUT' section of the chat
            <br>„ÄåMenu„Äç‚û°„ÄåSettings„Äç‚û°„ÄåChat„Äç‚û°„ÄåChat Filtering Settings„Äç‚û°„ÄåToggle Shout„Äç.
          </li>
          <li>If your phone can't handle Graphics, go to <br>„ÄåMenu„Äç‚û°„ÄåSettings„Äç‚û°„ÄåGraphics„Äçand check out the settings.
          </li>
          <li>You can fiddle around with a lot of settings here, it would be really useful.</li>
          <li>MENU -> Map -> World map are also helpful. The update in June 2021 has made it even easier to search and
            teleport to places.</li>
          <li>For Making the red AOE clearer go to „ÄåMenu„Äç‚û°„ÄåSettings„Äç‚û°„ÄåGraphics„Äç. Scroll down to bottom and find „ÄåAtk
            Warning Quality„Äçand„ÄåDisplay Settings„Äç.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Shortcuts</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>In„ÄåMenu„Äç‚û°„ÄåSettings„Äç‚û°„ÄåSystem„Äç‚û°„ÄåShortcuts„Äç, the different sets are literally different sets of shortcuts,
            for different situations. You cannot access a shortcut from set 2 if set 1 is enabled. </li>
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>The list is also a shortcut menu. You can tap the top of the page where it says„ÄåPage 1 ‚¨Ö„Äç and go to next
              page. Then tap the bottom "Shortcuts Off" to turn them on. </li>
            <li>How to access this list? On the home screen, there is a literal button called 'LIST'. Tap the top to go
              to next page, tap the bottom to close list.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Tap on your name when on the Home screen. You can set up Auto Potion (you need to have potions in your
            inventory and potions are not unlimited). You can also set up at what % of HP you want to consume the
            potion. </li>
          <li>Go to „ÄåMenu„Äç‚û°„ÄåSettings„Äç‚û°„ÄåGuard/Evasion settings„Äç‚û°„ÄåSet both to Manual A„Äç. Those will be easier for you now.
            Once you get more understanding of those, you can change them later.</li>

      <h3>Inventory</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>You access your inventory by „ÄåMenu„Äç‚û°„ÄåItems„Äç. Unlike most games, equipping a weapon/armor doesn't vanish it
            from the inventory. </li>
          <li>There are 50 inventory spaces, each can hold 99 items. A group of 99 items is called a stack. </li>
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Weapons and armor and additional gear and ring are non-stackable.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>You have a storage space, similar to a 'bank locker'. You can access it at any NPC store that has that
            feature. Usually in Sofya City, El Scaro, and Hora Diomedea. (Unfamiliar names, yes, but soon they will be
            familiar.)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This also has storage space. For increasing storage space in bank you can use orbs.</li>
            <li>One orb increases one storage space in personal inventory. (which you can move around)</li>
            <li> <strong>One orb opens one inventory slot, but one orb opens 5 bank slots. Choose carefully.</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>When in your inventory, tap an item. On the left are options on what to do with that item. Tap the„Äå1/2„Äç
            icon to open up more options on what to do with that item. </li>

      <h3>Stats</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="shifted-p">Early game, monsters are fairly easy, so it is recommended to add all stat points to boost
          ATK/MATK. For now, you don't have to worry about VIT stat. Defense, MaxHp, and MaxMP can be gained from
          equipments.
          <br> <br> <strong>HIT and FLEE are useless,</strong> as of given date above. The game is very unbalanced with
          respect to those. Monsters have unreasonably high HIT and FLEE compared to players. Don't try to increase
          these.

            The XIIIth Guy was a user on Toram Online Forums Years ago.
            <br> He and Mayan compiled a tome of offense and a tome of defense, the former of which is given here. <br>
            Hail the Holy Tome!!

      <h3>Levels</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>The current level cap is 230 as of the given above date.</li>
          <li>Toram Online is a 2015 game, so obviously, most players are high level and most
            events are aimed at level 150+ players. But, there are also events for all levels. You need not worry.</li>
          <li>Money, (currency called spina) is currently earned by mass killing mobs with an AOE and selling the
            materials (mats) to the NPC stores.
            The good AOE skills unlock at level 70, and if you need boosts on those you need to be level 150+</li>
          <li>If you don't want money and want to enjoy the game and the story normally while defeating mobs with hard
            work, you can do that. However,
            don't expect us to help you. That is because we already have a helping system in place by the name of
            mercenaries. </li>
          <li>Using„ÄåMENU„Äç‚û°„ÄåCommunity„Äç‚û°„ÄåGuild„Äç‚û°„ÄåMercinaries„Äçor just simply friend mercenaries or even hired mercenaries,
            you can easily fight bosses.
            Furthermore, if a boss is hard, you need to exit (standing on exit for 10 seconds) and reenter in easy mode.
          </li>
          <li>That's why, if you chose to do story mode while having fun, (while I will help because I enjoy helping)
            players will not help you and suggest you to put down your pride and do it in easy mode.
            If you want to do story with hard work and the feeling of winning, you need to do it on your own (or get a
            new player like you alongside)</li>
          <li>Iv'e already told you why people want to level up to level 150, it's to get stronger to fight mobs to earn
            spina.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="level-div">
          <h5>Do you Want to level up to 150 fast?</h5>
          <p class="shifted-p">If you are a newbie, the fastest way to get to level 150 is to play story up to chapter 9
            complete. You'll be at level 150 at the end of it. People will tell you to do the next chapters too.
            No need to do that, level 150 is enough. Save it up for future when you need exp to reach a benchmark level
            like 205 or 200.</p>

          <p class="shifted-p">If you already have a character at level 150, then the faster way is to get your
            guildmates and do something called as Powerleveling. It is the most efficient way of leveling.
            But you will need strong skills (tier 4 skills unlocked at level 150) to powerlevel fast. Your Guild will be
            able to help much better. </p>

    <!--Skills-->
    <section class="cards shadow" id="skills">
      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>Toram has a classless system meaning you can get skills from any skill tree.
            The weapon you choose in Tutorial only determines which skill page you unlock first. </li>
          <li>To upgrade skills you need to get skill pages. Those can be bought at the Sofya City library. Some pages
            are in books that you can't find in the library. Those books have special skills.
            Those can be purchased from other players or be won as prizes from treasure chests. (Complete chapter 2
            lesson 1 to understand what those are.)'</li>
          <li>Skill pages are divide into tiers. Tier 0 to 4.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Most (NOT ALL)</strong> main weapon skill pages from tier 0 and 1 are unlocked at level 0</li>
              <li>Tier 2 pages unlock at level 30</li>
              <li>Tier 3 pages unlock at level 70</li>
              <li>Tier 4 pages unlock at level 150</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Those levels are the levels of your highest leveled character. If you have a level 120 character and a
            level 40 character, then even the level 40 character can use tier 3 skills.
            If you then delete the level 120 character, then whatever pages you had purchased for the level 40 character
            remain. But you cannot get new pages. </li>
          <li>Tier 4 skills are the strongest and help you level your other characters faster and also farm faster.
            Hence everyone keeps telling you to do story up to chapter 9 and to get to level 150.
            If you want, you can enjoy the game at your own pace (It helps you learn combat skills and mechanics. I
            recommend it) But you won't find many people around your level because, Toram is an old game. People are
            already high level. </li>

        <ul class="lists">
          <li>You can trade with other people by tapping on them and clicking trading.
            You don't need to actually give them anything in trade, or even coins, though. You need to be able to see
            them though.
            <ul>
              <li>As always, more options show up on list when you tap the top arrow. </li>

          <li>You can gift a friend, party member or a guild member from long distance. This is however only one item at
            a time. You can also mail them over long distances, so they can see it when they come back online.</li>
          <li>Sofya City, El Scaro and Hora Diomedea have Trading boards called consignment boards. You can register
            your item there, and people will search for your item and buy it. However, the government taxes you. You can
            even do cross - server
            in
            this method, but then there's an ADDITIONAL tax.</li>
