# Toram Online Guide

## Description

A guide for newbies to Toram Online, a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game, or [MMORPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game) for short. 

This project initially began on Reddit, on my post titled [What to read if you are new](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToramOnline/comments/kir06y/what_to_read_if_you_are_new/). It was a way to help newbies find important sources of information quickly and not fill the subreddit with repeated queries.

It is a project intended to explore the possibilities of Web Development as I learn it, and also providing useful tools to people.
